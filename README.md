# CertiK
CertiK is blockchain security company which provides the leading security-focused ranking platform to analyze and monitor blockchain protocols and DeFi projects. <br/> <br/>
This repository includes the work for my economic research internship at CertiK from December 2019 to January 2020.<br/> <br/>
I built an economic incentive model and used statistical knowledge to analyze the Ethereum 2.0 and Cosmos Network, respectively.
